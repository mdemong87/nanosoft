                of the Goods, the Seller reserves the right at its option either to amend the quotation to cover any
                additional costs arising
                from such alteration or to rescind the contract. If the Seller rescinds in these circumstances the Buyer
                shall have no claim

                    expressly agreed by the Seller and the Buyer. Any quotations given by the Seller are valid for 30

                    during the period between the Seller's quotation of the price in that currency and payment by the
                    Buyer a change occurs in the official rate of exchange between the foreign currency and the pound
                    sterling then (without prejudice to the provision for the price escalation herein before contained)
                    the price shall be adjusted to such amount in the foreign currency as is equivalent at the new

                    delivers the goods to the independent carrier in accordance with clause 5.1.</li>
                <li>6.2 Where credit is given, the Buyer must pay the price for the Goods by the end of the month
                    following the month of Delivery of the Goods. The time for payment of the price is of the essence of
                    the contract.</li>
                <li>6.3 The Seller reserves the right to suspend deliveries where payment is not received in accordance

                    <ul>
                        <li>They become the Buyer's property: or</li>
                        <li>They are delivered to a purchaser from the Buyer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                        Seller may if still the owner of the Goods, recover and resell them. The Seller may enter the
                        Buyer's premises for this purpose. This does not affect any other right of the Seller.</p>

                        then the Risk in the Goods passes to the Buyer when the carrier collects the goods from the
                        Seller.</p>

            <ul>

                    <p>9.1 The Buyer must carefully examine the Goods immediately on delivery of them and must notify
                        the Seller in writing of any short delivery or any defects reasonably discoverable on careful
                        examination. This notification must be received by the Seller within 7 working days commencing
                        with the day of delivery to the Buyer. "Working days" means any day from Monday to Friday
                        (inclusive) which is not (in England and Wales) Christmas day, Good Friday or a statutory Bank
                        Holiday. In the absence of notification the Seller excludes all liability in respect of any
                        short delivery or any defect which should reasonably have been discovered on careful
                        examination.</p>

                        shall not be liable for any consequential or indirect loss suffered by the Buyer whether this
                        loss arises from breach of a duty in contract or tort or in any other way (including loss
                        arising from the Seller's negligence). Non-exhaustive illustrations of indirect loss would be:-
